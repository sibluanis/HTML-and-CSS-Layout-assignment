          	Motivation makes a big difference, and at CodersTrust we motivate first. This motivation is not only for earning money, this is also for adding social values through capacity building, leadership development and above all for the building of trusts. As you see, TRUST is in our name, thus we build trust and we earn trust,” a very confident Jan-Cayo was saying.

            Jan-Cayo Fiebig, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Co-Founder of CodersTrust was talking with Banglanews24.com at the country office and teaching center of this international organisation, located at Gulshan area in capital.

            Here at our center the students earn through learning. And as they learn and earn simultaneously, their confidences automatically take shapes, he said.

            Through the learn and earn path we have been making the dreams of many come true,”Jan-Cayo said and added that they have taught and graduated 1440 students in their less than 3-year of journey in Bangladesh that started in late Autumn of 2014.
